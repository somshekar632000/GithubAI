Welcome to the **Github AI Assistant**, an innovative tool designed to make exploring and understanding codebases effortless! With natural language queries, this chatbot empowers developers, data scientists, and teams to interact with code repositories seamlessly, whether you’re debugging, onboarding, or generating documentation. Works for `.py` and `.ipynb` only.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **💬 Natural Language Queries**  
  Ask questions about your codebase in plain English—no need to dig through files manually!  
  *Example:* “Explain the `process_data` function in `utils/helper.py`.”  
  *Example:* “What does line 45 in [main.py](http://main.py) do?”

- **📂 File and Code Chunk Analysis**  
  Dive deep into your code with detailed breakdowns of functions, classes, and non-function blocks.  
  Get precise explanations for specific lines or code sections.

- **📓 Jupyter Notebook Support**  
  Analyze individual cells in `.ipynb` files with ease.  
  *Example:* “Explain cell 3 in `notebooks/training.ipynb`.”

- **🔍 Semantic Search**  
  Find relevant code snippets even if your query doesn’t use exact terms.  
  *Example:* “Where is user authentication handled?” retrieves related code instantly.

- **🌐 Multi-Repository Support**  
  Manage up to 5 GitHub repositories at once.  
  Select from preprocessed repositories and start querying instantly.  
  Switch between repositories seamlessly without reprocessing.

- **⚡ Efficient Resource Management**  
  Optimized for large repositories, ensuring fast responses and minimal resource usage.

## 🎯 Use Cases

- **Code Exploration**: Quickly locate and understand functions, classes, or specific lines—perfect for onboarding or exploring unfamiliar repositories.  
- **Debugging Assistance**: Pinpoint issues by querying specific code sections and get insights into their functionality.  
- **Documentation Generation**: Generate clear explanations for code chunks to streamline documentation.  
- **Repository Insights**: Understand the structure and relationships between files and components in your codebase.

## 🛠️ How It Works

The Repository Chatbot intelligently processes your natural language queries, identifies intent, and extracts key details like file paths, function names, or line numbers. It then retrieves and analyzes the relevant code to deliver precise, context-aware answers.

### Example Queries
- *General*: “What’s the main purpose of this repository?”  
- *File-Specific*: “Explain `utils/helper.py`.”  
- *Function/Class-Specific*: “What does the `train_model` function in `models/neural_network.py` do?”  
- *Line Range*: “Explain lines 25-30 in `utils/data_loader.py`.”  
- *Notebook Cell*: “What happens in cell 3 of `notebooks/training.ipynb`?”

## Multi-Repository Workflow

- **Select a Repository**: Choose from up to 5 preprocessed GitHub repositories.  
- **Start Querying**: Instantly ask questions without waiting for processing.  
- **Switch Seamlessly**: Move between repositories with no delays.
